# Timetest

The purpose of this website is to se how fast I could create a web page based on a Figma design

I'm in my starting point of my career as a web developer, so this took me 12 hour to finish

The reason of this web page creation is to show future employers what I can do, so this is a work test

After I finished my course in HTML/CSS I recreated this Figma design on my free time

This is a single page build with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap

This is a static and fully responsive down to 320px

I build it from scratch with no templates
