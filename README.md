# Timetest

The purpose of this page is to se how fast I could create a web page based on a Figma design

I'm in my starting point of my career as a web developer, so this took me 12 hour to finish

The reason of this page creation is to show future employers what I can do, so this is a work test

After I finished my course in HTML/CSS, I recreated this Figma design on my free time

You can find figma file in this repo

This is a single page build with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap

This is a static and fully responsive page down to 320px

I build this page from scratch with no templates

This page has not been distributed as a web page
