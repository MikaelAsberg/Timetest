# Timetest

This site took me about 12 hours to finish. * 
I'm in the start of my career. * 
This site is just for showing what I can do. *
The main reason for this task is to show my skills for future employers. *
The main focus for this site is to show that I can follow a figma layout and make the site fully responsive down to 320px (Iphone 4). *
The site is build with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. No SASS this time, and no functionality with Javascript eather.
